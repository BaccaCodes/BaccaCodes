# ChewieSites
My sites. Ya that's it. Ya this is the repository for my horrible sites. You can also get a page here. Just read the info below I guess.

# License
So I set it to MIT. I don't actually really care so you can just do what you want with the code. Not that you would want my horrible code but ya know. Just give me credit or somthin'

# My Sites
So I will have a couple personal sites here. They will include some stuff like my projects, a blog, etc.

# Public Sites
So if you want to have a site of your own and for some reason can't get your own, you can get your site here on ChewieSites. You can get your site added in two ways.
1. Go to the `pub` folder. Fork the repository and create a folder named whatever your site name is. Add some HTML files like index.html. Then just commit the changes and make a pull request.
1. Contact me on Discord and tell me what you want for your site. My Discord is @Chewie#5684.

# Rules
##### I just have a few rules that you need to follow while using ChewieSites. I have organized them into different categories.

### Public Sites Content Rules/Guidelines
* Your site **may not contain NSFW content**.
* Your site should not contain controversial topics unless you are stating facts like news and do not give your own opinions on the matter. Do that in a place designed for that kind of stuff.
* Do not be offensive towards others in your site.

### Editing Other People's Sites
* If you have a suggestion for **my personal site here**, you may fork it and make edits and then send a pull request with your suggestion. If I like it, I will add it.
* If you want to make a suggestion/edit/addition for somebody else's site here, you can make edits and send a pull request but I will not add the change until the person has said it is ok.
* When making suggestions, it is OK to make constructive criticism but do not be rude or hurtful about it.
