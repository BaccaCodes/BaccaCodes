# ChewieSites
My sites. Ya that's it. Ya this is the repository for my horrible sites. You can also get a page here. Just read the info below I guess.

# License
So I set it to MIT. I don't actually really care so you can just do what you want with the code. Not that you would want my horrible code but ya know. Just give me credit or somthin'

# My Sites
So I will have a couple personal sites here. They will include some stuff like my projects, a blog, etc.

# Public Sites
So if you want to have a site of your own and for some reason can't get your own, you can get your site here on ChewieSites. You can get your site added in two ways.
1. Go to the `pub` folder. Fork the repository and create a folder and some HTML files. Then just commit the changes and make a pull request.
